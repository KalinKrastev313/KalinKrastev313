Hello, I am Kalin Krastev, from Bulgaria. 
Python is the first language I came upon and I find it intuitive and easy to learn. 
One can see that I am persisten explorer of the programing world. 
Half an year of commits to everyday exercises or small personal project can prove this. 
Still waiting to land my first job. 
My dream job: Taking part in engine development or cheat detection on a chess website (I know I have a lot to study to go there).
